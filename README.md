Scripts used to format UVP data for submission to data archival websites SeaBASS and BCO-DMO. UVP data must be downloaded from Ecotaxa's Particle Module in detailed ODV format first. 

The Underwater Video Profiler (UVP) is designed for the quantification of particles and of large zooplankton in the water column. Light reflected by undisturbed target objects forms a dark-field image.

SeaBASS <https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/#> is the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System, the publicly shared archive of in situ oceanographic and atmospheric data maintained by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). 
* Example dataset: 2018 EXPORTS UVP Data <https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/UAF/amcdonnell/EXPORTS/EXPORTSNP/archive>

BCO-DMO <https://www.bco-dmo.org/about-us> is the Biological & Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office.
* Example dataset: P16N Repeat Hydrography cruise in 2015 <https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/787966>
