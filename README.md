# UVP_submission_formatting
https://github.com/britairving/UVP_submission_formatting/

Scripts used to format UVP data for submission to data archival websites SeaBASS and BCO-DMO. UVP data must be downloaded from Ecotaxa's Particle Module in detailed ODV format first. 

The Underwater Video Profiler (UVP) is designed for the quantification of particles and of large zooplankton in the water column. Light reflected by undisturbed target objects forms a dark-field image.
